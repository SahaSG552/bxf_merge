## What is a BXF file?
The BXF file (Blum Exchange Format) not only contains information about the fitting, but also manufacturing information for wooden parts, such as cutting dimensions and drilling positions. The BXF file is created by the Product Configurator and Cabinet Configurator, which you can then import into your CAD software for further planning.

BXF is compatible with an increasing number of partner software products and can be easily transferred to drilling and insertion machines with EASYSTICK.
